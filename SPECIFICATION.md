# Memory API System Specification for CIBFE

## **Introduction**

This document describes a web-based Memory API system for AI agents built on the Cognitive Ingestion & Belief Formation Engine (CIBFE) architecture. The focus is on API definitions (internal module interfaces and external endpoints) and data contracts, using Java syntax for clarity. Implementation details are minimized in favor of interface specifications and design contracts. The design follows 12-factor app principles and SOLID object-oriented design, ensuring a cloud-native, modular, and maintainable system. Adhering to the twelve-factor methodology means the application is built with portability and scalability in mind, leveraging patterns for cloud-native services

. The SOLID design approach yields loosely coupled modules with clear responsibilities, making the system easier to understand, extend, and maintain

[bmc.com](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/solid-design-principles/#:~:text=Why%20use%20SOLID%20principles%20in,programming)

. Each module in CIBFE has a single responsibility (aligning with SRP of SOLID) and communicates via well-defined interfaces, supporting independent development and testing. This specification outlines external RESTful API endpoints for key operations (ingestion, categorization, encoding, belief updates, forgetting, retrieval) and internal Java interface definitions for each CIBFE module.

## **Architecture Overview**

CIBFE’s architecture is composed of six primary modules, each encapsulating a stage of the cognitive memory pipeline. Together, they enable intelligent memory management: the ability to retain valuable information and discard the irrelevant

. Without such managed memory, AI agents either become overloaded with useless data or lose important context over time

[lekha-bhan88.medium.com](https://lekha-bhan88.medium.com/autonomous-memory-management-in-agentic-ai-balancing-retention-and-forgetting-f5c50f2e5b9b#:~:text=Without%20this%2C%20agentic%20systems%20risk,personalization%2C%20or%20give%20incomplete%20answers)

. The modules work in sequence to ingest information, analyze and categorize it, encode it into long-term memory, update the agent’s belief system, prune irrelevant data, and retrieve relevant knowledge on demand. These modules can be deployed as microservices or as components within a single service, but in either case they interact through well-defined interfaces. This modular design (following interface segregation and dependency inversion principles) ensures that each component can evolve or be replaced independently without affecting others, promoting a robust and extensible system. Modules in CIBFE:

* Information Ingestion Module (IIM): Handles external inputs (text, data, events) and orchestrates the initial processing. It validates and transforms raw information into a standard format for the pipeline.
* Contextual Categorization Engine (CCE): Classifies incoming information into contextual categories or topics and attaches metadata tags. This helps organize knowledge and informs downstream processing (e.g. personal vs general info).
* Memory Encoding System (MES): Encodes categorized information into the long-term memory store. This could involve creating vector embeddings, indexing in databases, or linking to knowledge graphs, but those details are abstracted behind the interface.
* Belief Reinforcement & Conflict Analyzer (BRCA): Updates the agent’s belief state. It reinforces beliefs with consistent new evidence and detects conflicts or contradictions between new information and existing beliefs. This module maintains a coherent knowledge base or belief graph for the agent.
* Relevance Evaluation & Forgetting Agent (REFA): Periodically or on-demand evaluates stored memories for relevance. It implements “forgetting” of stale or irrelevant data, ensuring the memory store remains concise and pertinent
* [tanka.ai](https://www.tanka.ai/blog/posts/memunit-memgraph-and-memorg#:~:text=,while%20crucial%20knowledge%20is%20retained)
* . Outdated or low-value information is pruned while crucial knowledge is retained
* [tanka.ai](https://www.tanka.ai/blog/posts/memunit-memgraph-and-memorg#:~:text=,while%20crucial%20knowledge%20is%20retained)
* , preventing unbounded growth of memory.
* Retrieval & Response Engine (RRE): Handles queries for memory retrieval. Given a query or context (typically from the AI agent’s current task), RRE finds the most relevant stored information and returns it in a useful format. It may rank or filter results by context relevance and recency, and format responses for consumption by the agent or client.

Data Flow: When a client (or AI agent) sends new information via the ingestion API, the IIM accepts it and triggers the categorization process in the CCE. The categorized data is then passed to the MES to be stored as a memory record. After encoding, the BRCA is invoked to update internal beliefs, resolving any conflicts between the new memory and prior knowledge. The REFA may run asynchronously to assess if any older memories should be forgotten or down-ranked due to the new addition (for example, if the new data makes some old info obsolete). When the AI agent needs to recall information (for example, answering a user query), it calls the retrieval API, which uses RRE to fetch relevant memories (using contextual tags, similarity search, and belief scores). The retrieved data is then returned to the agent to inform its response. All modules are designed to be stateless processors (any state is stored in the memory repository or a database), consistent with 12-factor principles of stateless processes for easy scaling

.

## **External API Endpoints**

The Memory API exposes a set of RESTful HTTP endpoints (under a base path like /api/v1/memory for versioning) that allow clients or AI agents to interact with the memory system. Each endpoint corresponds to a high-level operation in the memory lifecycle. All endpoints consume and produce JSON, and require proper authentication (see Authentication & Versioning). The external API is designed with clear separation between concerns: clients perform high-level actions (add data, retrieve data, etc.), while the internal pipeline handles the complex processing. Below are the primary endpoints and their contracts:

### **Ingestion API (**POST /api/v1/memory/ingest**)**

Description: Ingest new information into the memory system. This is the main entry point for adding knowledge or observations. Clients (which may be AI agents or other services) send a piece of information, and the system will process it through categorization, encoding, and belief update internally.

* Request: HTTP POST with a JSON body representing the information to ingest. For example:

* { "agentId": "agent123", "content": "User said their favorite color is blue.", "source": "conversation", "timestamp": "2025-06-06T20:22:00Z", "metadata": { "importance": "normal", "tags": \["userPreference"\] } }
   Fields:
  * agentId (string): Identifier for the agent or context under which this memory is stored (to support multi-agent or multi-user scenarios).
  * content (string): The raw information or knowledge to store (text, could be a user utterance, fact, event description, etc.).
  * source (string): (Optional) Source/type of the information (e.g. "conversation", "sensor", "knowledge\_base"). This can guide categorization.
  * timestamp (string, ISO 8601): (Optional) When this information was generated or received. Used for temporal context and forgetting decisions.
  * metadata (object): (Optional) Additional contextual metadata or hints. Could include an explicit category tag, importance level, or other relevant flags. These are hints; the CCE may override or augment them.
* Response: JSON indicating the result of ingestion. For example:

* { "status": "success", "memoryId": "UUID-1234-5678", "category": "UserProfile", "encoded": true, "beliefsUpdated": \["UserLikesColor"\], "timestamp": "2025-06-06T20:22:01Z" }
   Fields:
  * memoryId (string): Unique identifier assigned to the stored memory record (generated by MES).
  * category (string): The category or context label assigned by the CCE (e.g., "UserProfile" if the system categorized the fact about user preference as profile info).
  * encoded (boolean): True if the memory was successfully encoded and stored.
  * beliefsUpdated (array of strings): List of any belief IDs or names that were updated or reinforced due to this information (if applicable). For example, "UserLikesColor" might represent a belief about the user's preferences.
  * status (string): "success" or error status. In error cases, this would be "error" and an errorMessage field would detail the issue (e.g., validation failure).
  * timestamp (string): Server timestamp when the ingestion was processed.

Behavior: On receiving an ingest request, the system (via IIM) validates the input and calls the internal pipeline: the CCE categorizes the content (using context or possibly NLP to determine what kind of info it is), then MES encodes and stores it as a memory entry. After storage, BRCA updates the agent’s belief model (if the new info affects any beliefs, e.g., adding a new fact about the user). The response is returned once the process completes. This endpoint is synchronous for simplicity – it returns after the memory is stored and initial belief updates are done. (In a high-throughput scenario, the system could ingest asynchronously, but then the API would likely return a job ID instead of waiting.)

### **Categorization API (**POST /api/v1/memory/categorize**)**

Description: Classify a given piece of information into a contextual category without necessarily storing it. This endpoint is primarily for external tools or admins to utilize the categorization engine (CCE) directly. In most cases, clients won’t need to call this explicitly (since ingest covers it), but it is exposed for completeness or specialized usage (for instance, to preview how data *would* be categorized).

* Request: HTTP POST with JSON containing the content to categorize (and optionally context or metadata). Example:

* { "content": "John Doe was born in 1990 and lives in Paris.", "metadata": { "agentId": "agent123", "source": "user\_profile" } }
  * content (string): The raw content to categorize.
  * metadata (object): (Optional) Additional context such as agentId or source that might influence categorization.
* Response: JSON with classification result. Example:

* { "category": "PersonalData", "subCategory": "Biography", "tags": \["person:John Doe", "birthYear:1990", "location:Paris"\] }
   Fields:
  * category (string): High-level category assigned (e.g., "PersonalData").
  * subCategory (string): (Optional) More granular classification if applicable (e.g., "Biography").
  * tags (array of strings): (Optional) Any specific tags or semantic annotations extracted (for example, identified entities or attributes).

Behavior: The CCE is invoked to analyze the content. It may use ontologies or NLP models to determine the semantic context of the information. For example, the engine might recognize that the sentence contains personal information about an individual (name, birth date, location) and classify accordingly. The result is not stored as memory by this endpoint (unless followed by an explicit ingest call); it’s just a classification service. This endpoint helps with external validation or custom categorization tasks, and demonstrates how the CCE can be used independently.

### **Memory Encoding API (**POST /api/v1/memory/encode**)**

Description: Encode and store information into memory, assuming it has already been categorized. This is a lower-level endpoint that writes directly to the memory store (MES) and should include categorization metadata. Typically used for bulk import or when skipping the automated categorization step (if the category is already known). Like the categorize API, this is mainly for advanced or internal use; the normal flow is via ingest.

* Request: HTTP POST with JSON containing the data to encode. Example:

* { "agentId": "agent123", "content": "Paris is the capital of France.", "category": "WorldFact", "metadata": { "source": "knowledge\_base", "confidence": 0.9 } }
   Required fields:
  * content (string): The raw data or knowledge to store.
  * category (string): Category under which to store this content (the caller must provide it, since categorization is assumed done).
  * agentId (string): Context/owner of the memory (similar to above).
  * metadata (object): (Optional) Additional metadata such as source, confidence score, tags, etc.
* Response: JSON confirming the storage. Example:

* { "status": "success", "memoryId": "UUID-8899-7766", "stored": { "content": "Paris is the capital of France.", "category": "WorldFact", "agentId": "agent123", "timestamp": "2025-06-06T20:25:00Z" } }
   Fields:
  * memoryId: The unique ID of the new memory record (generated by the system).
  * stored: An object echoing details of what was stored (content, category, agent, timestamp).
  * status: "success" or "error" with errorMessage if failed.

Behavior: This calls the MES directly to persist the provided data as a memory entry, using the given category and metadata. Internally, MES will likely generate an identifier, index the content (e.g., create a vector embedding or add to a database index), and store it in the long-term memory repository. Since this bypasses IIM and CCE, it expects well-formed inputs. The BRCA may still be triggered to update beliefs based on this new memory (particularly if source indicates a knowledge base update). This endpoint can be used to import existing knowledge (for example, seeding the memory with facts from a database on system initialization) without recategorization.

### **Belief Update API (**POST /api/v1/memory/belief-update**)**

Description: Trigger a belief update and conflict analysis explicitly. This endpoint forces the Belief Reinforcement & Conflict Analyzer (BRCA) to run, for instance after a batch of new memories have been added, or as a periodic maintenance operation. In most cases, BRCA runs automatically during ingestion, but this API gives fine control to administrators or developers for manual invocations (e.g., re-evaluating all beliefs).

* Request: HTTP POST (no required body, or optionally a JSON specifying scope):
  Example with optional parameters:

* { "agentId": "agent123", "memoryIds": \["UUID-1234-5678", "UUID-2233-4455"\] }
  * agentId (string, optional): If provided, restricts the belief update to a particular agent’s knowledge base (for multi-tenant systems).
  * memoryIds (array of strings, optional): If provided, the update focus is on specific new or modified memories (otherwise the BRCA will review the entire knowledge base or recent changes).
* Response: JSON summarizing the update results. Example:

* { "status": "success", "updatedBeliefs": \[ { "id": "Belief-45", "content": "Paris is the capital of France", "confidence": 0.95 }, { "id": "Belief-12", "content": "User likes blue color", "confidence": 0.80 } \], "conflictsDetected": \[ { "memoryId": "UUID-3344-5566", "conflictingBeliefId": "Belief-9", "resolution": "deprecated\_memory" } \], "timestamp": "2025-06-06T20:30:00Z" }
   Fields:
  * updatedBeliefs: List of belief entries that were reinforced or adjusted. Each might include an ID, a representation of the belief, and perhaps an updated confidence or strength level.
  * conflictsDetected: List of any conflicts found between memories and existing beliefs. Each entry might show a memory that conflicted with a belief or another memory, and how it was handled (e.g., marking one as deprecated or raising an alert for human review).
  * status: "success" or "error", plus timestamp of the operation.

Behavior: When called, the BRCA module will examine the relevant memory entries and the current set of beliefs. It will apply logic to reinforce beliefs that have new supporting evidence (for example, if multiple memories indicate the same fact, it can increase confidence in that fact) and to detect contradictions (e.g., if a new memory says *X is true* but an existing belief says *X is false*, a conflict is logged). The system may have strategies for conflict resolution: it could mark one of the pieces of information as possibly outdated, lower confidence in a belief, or simply record the conflict for external resolution. The outcome of this process is reported by the API. This endpoint helps maintain consistency in the AI’s knowledge base, ensuring the agent’s beliefs reflect the latest information while flagging inconsistencies.

### **Forgetting API (**POST /api/v1/memory/forget**)**

Description: Initiate a relevance evaluation and forgetting process. This endpoint engages the Relevance Evaluation & Forgetting Agent (REFA) to prune irrelevant or stale memories. In normal operation, REFA might run periodically in the background, but this API allows on-demand invocation or custom control (for example, to enforce memory limits or to implement a user’s request to delete their data). Intelligent forgetting is vital for preventing memory overload and focusing the agent on what matters

[lekha-bhan88.medium.com](https://lekha-bhan88.medium.com/autonomous-memory-management-in-agentic-ai-balancing-retention-and-forgetting-f5c50f2e5b9b#:~:text=information%2C%20and%20work%20across%20time,matters%20and%20forget%20what%20doesn%E2%80%99t)

* Request: HTTP POST with optional parameters to define the scope or criteria for forgetting. Example:

* { "agentId": "agent123", "strategy": "age", "threshold": "30d" }
   Possible fields:
  * agentId (string, optional): Limit forgetting to the specified agent’s memory.
  * strategy (string, optional): Forgetting strategy to apply. Examples: "age" to remove items older than a certain time, "least\_used" to remove least accessed items, "score" to remove items with low relevance score.
  * threshold (string or number, optional): A value used with the strategy. For "age", this could be a duration like "30d" (30 days); for "least\_used" perhaps a count or percentile; for "score" a relevance score cutoff.
  * Alternatively, a request might specify explicit memoryId list to forget specific items (e.g., for GDPR “right to be forgotten” use cases).
* Response: JSON summary of what was forgotten or retained. Example:

* { "status": "success", "removedCount": 12, "removedItems": \[ { "memoryId": "UUID-1111", "reason": "expired" }, { "memoryId": "UUID-2222", "reason": "low\_relevance\_score" } \], "retainedCount": 230, "timestamp": "2025-06-06T20:35:00Z" }
   Fields:
  * removedCount: Number of memory entries deleted or archived.
  * removedItems: (Optional) List of identifiers of removed memory items and possibly the reason/criterion that caused each to be removed.
  * retainedCount: Current count of memories retained (post-forgetting) for that agent or context (if applicable). This gives an idea of remaining memory size.
  * status and timestamp as usual.

Behavior: The REFA module evaluates memories against configured relevance criteria. It might compute a relevance score per memory based on factors like recency, frequency of access, importance tags, and association with current active topics. This endpoint triggers that evaluation. Depending on the strategy, it then either soft-deletes or permanently removes memories that fall below thresholds or are older than a time limit. The design should allow plugging in different strategies (e.g., time-based forgetting, score-based compression, or even manual flags). Automated categorization and indexing done earlier (by CCE/MES) support this by providing metadata and access frequency statistics for REFA to use

. By pruning irrelevant data, the system ensures that the AI’s active memory remains efficient and focused, avoiding the twin failure modes of either overload or important info loss

[lekha-bhan88.medium.com](https://lekha-bhan88.medium.com/autonomous-memory-management-in-agentic-ai-balancing-retention-and-forgetting-f5c50f2e5b9b#:~:text=Without%20this%2C%20agentic%20systems%20risk,personalization%2C%20or%20give%20incomplete%20answers)

. (Important data is retained due to prioritization in the evaluation step

[tanka.ai](https://www.tanka.ai/blog/posts/memunit-memgraph-and-memorg#:~:text=,while%20crucial%20knowledge%20is%20retained)

.) The forgetting operation might also archive removed items elsewhere if needed (to enable possible recovery or auditing), but such details are beyond this spec’s scope.

### **Retrieval API (**GET /api/v1/memory/retrieve **or** POST /api/v1/memory/retrieve**)**

Description: Retrieve relevant memories based on a query or context. This is used by AI agents to recall information from their long-term memory to inform decisions or generate responses. The Retrieval & Response Engine (RRE) handles the query, finds matching or related memory entries, and returns them in an organized manner. If using HTTP GET, the query can be passed as request parameters; if using POST, a JSON body can provide a richer query structure.

* Request (GET example):
  GET /api/v1/memory/retrieve?agentId=agent123\&query=favorite+color\&limit=5
  Query parameters:
  * agentId (string): The agent or context whose memory to search.
  * query (string): The search query or key terms (could be a natural language question or keywords).
  * limit (int, optional): Max number of results to return.
  * filterCategory (string, optional): If provided, restrict results to a category (e.g., UserProfile).
    (For more complex queries, a POST with JSON can be used, allowing structures like vectors or multiple fields filters.)
* Request (POST example):

* { "agentId": "agent123", "query": "What is the user's favorite color?", "context": \["recent\_conversation\_ID\_789"\], "filters": { "category": "UserProfile" }, "limit": 5 }
   Fields:
  * query: The query string (which might be a direct question or keywords).
  * context: (Optional) Additional context like references to recent interaction or a specific conversation ID, which RRE could use to augment retrieval (for example, retrieving only memories relevant to the ongoing conversation).
  * filters: (Optional) Key-value pairs to filter the search (category, date range, etc.).
  * limit: Max number of memory records to return.
* Response: JSON with retrieved memory entries. Example:

* { "results": \[ { "memoryId": "UUID-1234-5678", "content": "User said their favorite color is blue.", "category": "UserProfile", "timestamp": "2025-06-06T20:22:00Z", "metadata": { "source": "conversation", "confidence": 0.9 } }, { "memoryId": "UUID-2233-4455", "content": "The user bought a blue car last year.", "category": "UserProfile", "timestamp": "2024-12-01T10:00:00Z", "metadata": { "source": "transaction\_log", "confidence": 0.7 } } \], "query": "What is the user's favorite color?", "agentId": "agent123", "count": 2 }
   Fields:
  * results: Array of memory objects that are relevant to the query, sorted by relevance (most likely). Each object includes at least the memoryId, original content stored, category, and possibly the timestamp and any metadata such as source or a relevance/confidence score.
  * count: Number of results returned (useful when limit is used or for pagination if applicable).
  * Echo of the query and agentId for reference.

Behavior: The RRE module processes the query by searching the memory store. This could involve full-text search, semantic vector similarity, and filtering by context or category. The engine may use indexes or embeddings created by the MES. It might also incorporate belief scores or recency as part of ranking, ensuring that the most contextually relevant and important information surfaces first (e.g., if the agent has multiple favorite color statements, the most recent or reinforced one is returned at the top). RRE’s job is to abstract the retrieval logic so the client (agent) can simply query in natural terms. The endpoint supports both simple keyword queries and more complex usage (like providing context identifiers). In a conversation, an agent could call this to fetch facts about the user or past events related to the current topic. The retrieval results enable the agent to have continuity and awareness over long-term interactions, overcoming the short-term memory limits of the underlying language model

[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.13044v1#:~:text=architecture%20unchanged,insights%20from%20cognitive%20AI%20offer)

. Optionally, RRE can also format results or compile a brief summary; however, typically the agent (or a higher-level service) would take the raw memory entries and decide how to use them (e.g., include them in a prompt to an LLM for generating the final answer).

### **Additional Endpoints**

In addition to the core endpoints above, the system may provide administrative or supporting endpoints, such as:

* GET /api/v1/memory/{id}: Retrieve a specific memory entry by its ID (direct access). Useful for auditing or reference, returns the memory content and metadata if authorized.
* DELETE /api/v1/memory/{id}: Delete a specific memory entry. This could be used as an alternative to the forgetting API for targeted deletion (for example, removing a piece of information on user request).
* GET /api/v1/memory/beliefs: Retrieve current beliefs/state for an agent (returns a summary of key beliefs and confidence levels). This can help in transparency or debugging of what the AI “believes” at a given time.
* GET /api/v1/memory/status: Health check or status of the memory system (e.g., number of memories stored, last maintenance run, etc.).

These endpoints are optional and can be included as needed. The main focus remains on the six primary operations that mirror the CIBFE modules.

## **Internal Module Interface Definitions**

The internal architecture is defined by Java interfaces for each module, enforcing clear contracts between components. Each interface represents a service that could have one or multiple implementations (facilitating testing and future upgrades, e.g., a different categorization algorithm or storage backend can be used without changing other parts). Following SOLID principles, each interface has methods focused only on that module’s responsibility. Dependency inversion is applied by depending on these abstract interfaces rather than concrete classes, so that modules can be wired together flexibly (via dependency injection). Below we provide Java-style interface definitions for the six modules. These definitions use simplified types for clarity (actual implementations might integrate with frameworks or external libraries, but that is abstracted out here).

### **Information Ingestion Module (IIM) Interface**


public interface InformationIngestionModule { */\*\* \* Ingests raw information into the memory system. \** @param input The raw input data (content, metadata, context) to ingest. \* @return IngestionResult containing memory ID, category, and status of the operation. \*/ IngestionResult ingest(MemoryInput input); */\*\* \* Optionally, validate or preprocess input data before ingestion. \* Could be used internally prior to calling ingest(). \*/* void validateInput(MemoryInput input) throws InvalidInputException; }
Role: The IIM serves as the orchestrator for new information entering the system. Its primary method ingest() accepts a MemoryInput (a DTO containing content, agent ID, source, etc.) and returns an IngestionResult. When ingest() is called, the implementation will typically perform validation, then call into the Contextual Categorization Engine and Memory Encoding System as needed (likely via their interfaces) to complete the pipeline. This interface decouples the ingestion logic from web frameworks – the external API controller would use InformationIngestionModule.ingest() to handle the HTTP request. The validateInput method (optional in interface, could also be internal) ensures the payload meets required format (not null, content length, etc.). By separating ingestion logic here, we uphold single-responsibility: the ingestion module deals only with orchestrating the intake of data, not how categorization or storage is done. Other components can call ingest() (for example, a batch importer service) without needing to know the internals of categorization or encoding.

### **Contextual Categorization Engine (CCE) Interface**


public interface ContextualCategorizationEngine { */\*\* \* Categorizes a piece of information in context. \** @param content The textual content or data to categorize. \* @param meta Optional metadata (e.g., source, agent context) that can inform categorization. \* @return A CategoryLabel representing the assigned category (and possibly subcategories/tags). \*/ CategoryLabel categorize(String content, Metadata meta); */\*\* \* Enhances metadata with context-derived tags or entities. \* This method might extract semantic tags (entities, keywords). \** @param content The content to analyze. \* @return A set of tags or annotations derived from the content. \*/ Set\<String\> extractTags(String content); }

Role: The CCE provides classification of content. The categorize() method returns a CategoryLabel (likely a custom type containing a main category, optional subcategory, and maybe confidence score). It takes the raw content string and any metadata (which could include hints like specified category or agent info). The method encapsulates whatever algorithm or model is used (rules, ML model, etc.) to decide how to label the information. The second method extractTags is an auxiliary feature to pull out key descriptors from the content (for example, if the content mentions a place or date, it might generate tags like location:Paris, year:1990). This demonstrates the capability of enriching the categorization with fine-grained context, which can be stored in memory metadata. Implementations of CCE might use ontologies or NLP as hinted; for example, an ontology-based approach could ensure consistent tagging and categorization

[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.13044v1#:~:text=The%20figure%20shows%20a%20structured,memory%20tagging%20and%20contextual%20retrieval)

[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.13044v1#:~:text=Figure%202%2C%20the%20interaction%20with,to%20ensure%20a%20contextually%20appropriate)

. By having a dedicated interface, one could swap out a rule-based categorizer for an ML model without affecting other modules. The IIM will call categorize() and then pass the resulting label to MES. The CCE may also be used independently via the categorize API, as defined above.

### **Memory Encoding System (MES) Interface**


public interface MemoryEncodingSystem { */\*\* \* Encodes and stores information into long-term memory. \** @param content The content to store. \* @param category The category label under which to store the content. \* @param meta Metadata including agentId, timestamp, tags, etc. \* @return MemoryRecord representing the stored memory (with ID and storage details). \*/ MemoryRecord encodeAndStore(String content, CategoryLabel category, Metadata meta); */\*\* \* Retrieves a stored memory by its ID. \** @param memoryId The unique identifier of the memory. \* @return The MemoryRecord if found, or null if not found. \*/ MemoryRecord getMemory(String memoryId); */\*\* \* Deletes or archives a memory entry by ID (used by forgetting processes). \** @param memoryId The ID of the memory to remove. \* @return true if the memory was removed, false if not found. \*/ boolean removeMemory(String memoryId); }
Role: The MES interface defines how data gets persisted and managed in the long-term store. The main method encodeAndStore takes the raw content along with its category (from CCE) and metadata, and returns a MemoryRecord. Internally, this is where encoding logic occurs: e.g., generating an embedding vector for semantic search, compressing the content if needed, and writing to a database or knowledge base. The interface doesn’t specify *how* (could be a SQL database, a NoSQL store, or an in-memory structure), just the contract. The returned MemoryRecord contains at least an id and stored fields (content, category, etc., possibly a reference to stored vector or location). Additional methods getMemory and removeMemory provide basic CRUD operations on the memory store (these might be used by retrieval and forgetting flows respectively). removeMemory is used by REFA when forgetting items, and possibly by external DELETE endpoint. By providing these methods, MES abstracts data storage with an interface that controllers or other modules can use directly if needed (for example, RRE might call getMemory when constructing detailed responses or confirming something exists). The design anticipates future extension – for instance, adding an updateMemory method for editing existing records, or methods to bulk import/export memories – without breaking existing contracts (open-closed principle).

### **Belief Reinforcement & Conflict Analyzer (BRCA) Interface**


public interface BeliefReinforcementConflictAnalyzer { */\*\* \* Analyzes a newly stored memory and updates beliefs accordingly. \** @param newMemory The MemoryRecord that was recently added. \* @return BeliefUpdateResult detailing any belief changes (reinforcements or conflicts). \*/ BeliefUpdateResult analyzeNewMemory(MemoryRecord newMemory); */\*\* \* Performs a full review of the belief base for consistency and reinforcement. \* Can be run periodically or on-demand. \** @return a list of conflicts detected (if any), or an empty list if all consistent. \*/ List\<ConflictReport\> reviewAllBeliefs(); }

Role: The BRCA interface handles the logic of keeping the agent’s belief model in sync with the memories. The analyzeNewMemory method is invoked whenever a new MemoryRecord is added (from MES) to update the belief system incrementally. For example, if the new memory is “User’s favorite color is blue”, the analyzer might update a belief like *FavoriteColor(user) \= blue* (reinforcing it if it existed or creating it anew). It returns a BeliefUpdateResult – a DTO that could list which belief was updated, new confidence level, or if a conflict was found (e.g., previously the system believed the favorite color was red). The second method reviewAllBeliefs provides a comprehensive scan (this would be used by the explicit belief-update API or maybe a nightly job). It goes through the entire belief store, possibly cross-checking for contradictions among all memories, and returns a list of conflict reports (each might include the conflicting items and suggested resolution). By separating belief management, the system distinguishes between raw memory (which may contain redundancies or errors) and structured beliefs (which are like distilled knowledge). This module ensures that frequently confirmed information is noted (belief reinforced) and contradictory information is flagged for resolution

[tanka.ai](https://www.tanka.ai/blog/posts/memunit-memgraph-and-memorg#:~:text=,while%20crucial%20knowledge%20is%20retained)

. The interface allows different implementations: a simple one might just store key-value facts and count occurrences, whereas a complex one could use logical inference or even integrate a knowledge graph. In all cases, other modules (IIM or a scheduler) call these methods; the rest of the system doesn’t need to know how beliefs are managed internally. This promotes maintainability: if we refine our belief model approach, we implement a new BRCA without changing ingestion or retrieval logic.

### **Relevance Evaluation & Forgetting Agent (REFA) Interface**


public interface RelevanceEvaluationForgettingAgent { */\*\* \* Evaluates and assigns a relevance score to a memory item. \** @param memory The memory record to evaluate. \* @return a relevance score (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0) indicating importance. \*/ double evaluateRelevance(MemoryRecord memory); */\*\* \* Performs a forgetting cycle based on a given strategy. \** @param strategy A specification of the forgetting strategy (e.g., age-based, score-based). \* @return ForgettingReport summarizing removed and remaining memories. \*/ ForgettingReport performForgetting(ForgettingStrategy strategy); }

Role: The REFA interface encapsulates logic for deciding what to forget and carrying it out. The evaluateRelevance method can be used to score individual memory items – for example, based on how recently it was used, how frequently it's been accessed, or an importance flag. This could be used internally by performForgetting or even by RRE to rank results. The performForgetting method accepts a ForgettingStrategy (could be an enum or object detailing the criterion such as "AGE \> 30d" or "LOW\_SCORE") and returns a ForgettingReport. The ForgettingReport DTO would mirror what the API outputs: which items were removed and how many remain. In practice, calling performForgetting would involve: scanning the memory store (likely via MES interface) for items meeting the removal criteria, then using MES.removeMemory(id) to remove each. The strategy can determine what threshold to apply (for example, remove all with relevance score below 0.2). The design is such that new strategies can be added without changing the interface – one could extend ForgettingStrategy to include new fields or types, and the implementation can handle them (open for extension). By adjusting the strategy, this module can cover different forgetting policies, from simple ones like time-based expiration to complex ones like semantic compression (e.g., summarize and store summary, delete details). The interface keeps those details abstracted. The rest of the system (like an admin API call or a scheduled job) simply calls performForgetting with the desired strategy, then possibly logs the report or returns it to the caller. This modular approach ensures the critical function of memory pruning (which prevents overload and maintains performance) is cleanly separated and tunable

.

### **Retrieval & Response Engine (RRE) Interface**


public interface RetrievalResponseEngine { */\*\* \* Searches the memory store for relevant entries given a query. \** @param query The search query (could be keywords or natural language). \* @param filters Optional filters (e.g., category or agent scope). \* @param limit Max number of results to return. \* @return a list of MemoryRecord results matching the query, sorted by relevance. \*/ List\<MemoryRecord\> retrieveRelevant(String query, FilterOptions filters, int limit); */\*\* \* Optionally, generates a response or summary from retrieved memories for a given query. \** @param query The original query or question. \* @param memories List of MemoryRecords relevant to the query. \* @return A composed response (e.g., an answer or a summary using the memory). \*/ String composeResponse(String query, List\<MemoryRecord\> memories); }

Role: The RRE is responsible for querying the memory and providing results. The retrieveRelevant method is the core search function: given a query and optional filter criteria, it returns a list of MemoryRecord objects that best match. The search may use full-text matching on MemoryRecord.content, semantic similarity (if vectors are stored), or even query the belief store for relevant facts. FilterOptions might include agentId, categories, date ranges, etc., to narrow the search. The interface does not dictate how the search is implemented (it could leverage a search index or call an external search service), just that it returns memory records. The composeResponse method is an extra capability: it takes the query and the raw memory results and produces a human-readable response or summary. For instance, if the query was "What is the user's favorite color?" and multiple memory records about color preferences were retrieved, this method might decide on the most likely answer (“The user’s favorite color is blue, based on recent information.”). This method might call an LLM or use a template to formulate the answer. However, its usage is optional – in some designs, the agent itself (outside the memory system) might handle final answer composition by integrating the memory results. We include it to show that RRE can be extended to not just retrieve but also to post-process retrievals into a useful form, hence the name Retrieval & *Response* Engine. By splitting retrieveRelevant and composeResponse, we uphold interface segregation – consumers who only need raw data can ignore the compose feature. For example, an external API might just call retrieveRelevant and return those results, while a higher-level service could use composeResponse to get a natural answer string. The RRE ensures that retrieval is efficient (likely using indexes created by MES) and relevant, possibly employing context filtering so that the AI agent only gets information appropriate to the situation

## **Data Models and DTOs**

Various data transfer objects (DTOs) and models are used in the API transactions and internal interface methods. Defining these data structures is crucial for the contracts. Below are the key models and their intended structure (in a Java-like pseudocode for clarity):

* MemoryInput: Represents an input to the ingestion process (used by IIM).
* java
* Copy
* Edit
* public class MemoryInput { private String agentId; private String content; private String source; private Instant timestamp; private Metadata metadata; *// could include tags, importance, etc.* *// \+ constructors, getters, setters* }
   Fields correspond to what the Ingestion API expects: raw content, context info, etc. Metadata here might be a map or a typed object for additional fields (like importance or provided category hints).
* IngestionResult: The outcome of an ingestion operation.
* java
* Copy
* Edit
* public class IngestionResult { private String memoryId; private CategoryLabel category; private boolean encoded; private List\<String\> updatedBeliefIds; private Status status; private String errorMessage; *// \+ getters, etc.* }
   It contains the new memory’s ID, category assigned, a flag if stored, any beliefs that were touched, and a status. Status could be an enum for SUCCESS/ERROR, and errorMessage would be populated if status is error. This corresponds to the response of the ingest endpoint.
* CategoryLabel: Represents a category (and possibly subcategory) assigned by CCE.
* java
* Copy
* Edit
* public class CategoryLabel { private String primary; private String secondary; *// optional, or could be a list for hierarchical categories* private Set\<String\> tags; *// semantic tags or key annotations* private double confidence; *// e.g., primary="UserProfile", secondary="Preferences", tags={"color"}, confidence=0.95* }
   This object is returned by CCE and passed into MES. It encapsulates the classification of content. The tags might be those extracted by extractTags().
* Metadata: General-purpose metadata structure. This could simply be a Map\<String, Object\> in implementation, but conceptually it includes any extra info attached to a memory (source, importance, user-provided tags, etc.). Some fields in Metadata might be standardized (like importance as integer/enum, lastAccessed timestamp which MES updates on retrieval, etc.). It’s used in MemoryInput and MemoryRecord.
* MemoryRecord: The representation of a stored memory entry in the system.
* java
* Copy
* Edit
* public class MemoryRecord { private String id; private String agentId; private String content; private CategoryLabel category; private Metadata metadata; private Instant createdAt; private Instant lastAccessed; *// Possibly an embedding vector or reference, but that would be hidden internally.* }
   This model is the core unit of storage. It contains the original content (or a reference if content is stored elsewhere), the category label assigned, metadata (which might include tags, source, and possibly a relevance score updated over time), creation timestamp, and last accessed timestamp (for use in forgetting algorithms). If using vector embeddings, the MemoryRecord might hold an identifier to a vector in an index rather than the vector itself, depending on implementation.
* BeliefUpdateResult: Used by BRCA to convey what happened when analyzing a new memory.
* java
* Copy
* Edit
* public class BeliefUpdateResult { private List\<Belief\> reinforcedBeliefs; private List\<BeliefConflict\> conflicts; private List\<Belief\> newBeliefs; *// e.g., if a new belief was formed or an old one updated/confirmed* }
   This DTO could list which beliefs got reinforced (with references to those belief objects or IDs), any conflicts detected (perhaps as BeliefConflict objects containing details), and any entirely new beliefs created. A Belief could be another model representing a unit of knowledge the agent holds abstractly, e.g.:
* java
* Copy
* Edit
* public class Belief { private String id; private String statement; private double confidence; private Set\<String\> evidenceMemoryIds; *// etc.* }
   For example, a belief might be "User (id) likes color blue" with some confidence, and evidenceMemoryIds linking to the memory records that support it.
* ConflictReport / BeliefConflict: Used to represent a conflict found by BRCA.
* java
* Copy
* Edit
* public class BeliefConflict { private String beliefId; private String memoryId; private String description; private ConflictResolution resolution; }
   This would contain what belief was in conflict with what memory (or maybe conflict between two beliefs), a description of the issue, and what was done or suggested (the ConflictResolution could be an enum like TAKE\_NEW, KEEP\_OLD, MARK\_UNCERTAIN, or require manual review).
* ForgettingStrategy: Input to REFA’s performForgetting. This could be an enum or a class for extensibility.
* java
* Copy
* Edit
* public enum ForgettingStrategyType { AGE, LEAST\_USED, LOW\_SCORE, CUSTOM } public class ForgettingStrategy { private ForgettingStrategyType type; private Duration maxAge; *// for AGE* private int retainCount; *// maybe for least-used (retain N most used)* private double scoreThreshold; *// for LOW\_SCORE* *// \+ perhaps custom function or additional fields for other strategies* }
   This structure allows specifying how to decide what to forget. Only relevant fields would be set depending on type.
* ForgettingReport: Output of forgetting operation.
* java
* Copy
* Edit
* public class ForgettingReport { private int removedCount; private List\<String\> removedIds; private int remainingCount; private ForgettingStrategy appliedStrategy; *// maybe details like total before/after* }
   It contains counts and list of removed memory IDs (if needed for logging or auditing), and what strategy was applied (echoed back).
* FilterOptions: Used by RRE retrieval to encapsulate query filters.
* java
* Copy
* Edit
* public class FilterOptions { private String agentId; private String category; private Instant since; private Instant until; *// etc. Any filter criteria to narrow search.* }
   This is passed to retrieveRelevant along with the query string. For example, one can set agentId to ensure only that agent’s memories are searched, or set a category filter to only retrieve certain types of info, or a date range.
* Status: A simple enum for operation status, e.g.: enum Status { SUCCESS, ERROR; }. Used in various responses like IngestionResult.

These models support the API by ensuring both external requests/responses and internal method signatures share common definitions of data. By using DTOs (and interfaces returning these DTOs), we maintain a separation between the data representation and business logic. They also make the system easy to extend — for instance, adding a new field to Metadata or a new type of Belief does not break the interface contracts as long as we handle default behaviors, aligning with open-closed principle. All data classes would override toString() for logging and be serializable to JSON for API output.

## **Usage Examples**

To illustrate how clients (e.g., AI agent modules or other services) would use the Memory API, this section provides usage scenarios for key endpoints. These examples assume an HTTP REST client, but one could also use a Java client library that wraps the API.

### **Example 1: Ingesting New Information**

Scenario: After a user interacts with an AI assistant, the assistant wants to remember a fact from the conversation – the user’s favorite color is blue. The assistant calls the ingestion API to store this fact. Request: The assistant makes an HTTP POST to the /api/v1/memory/ingest endpoint. For example, using curl for demonstration:



curl \-X POST https://api.example.com/api/v1/memory/ingest \\ \-H "Content-Type: application/json" \-H "Authorization: Bearer \<TOKEN\>" \\ \-d '{ "agentId": "assistant\_001", "content": "The user stated their favorite color is blue.", "source": "chat\_message", "timestamp": "2025-06-06T20:22:00Z", "metadata": { "importance": "high" } }'
Response: A successful response returns HTTP 200 with a JSON body:



{ "status": "success", "memoryId": "5f8ac10b-708f-4d5b-9e18-6d34a9d3c888", "category": "UserProfile", "encoded": true, "beliefsUpdated": \["Belief-UserPreference-Color"\], "timestamp": "2025-06-06T20:22:01Z" }
This indicates the memory was stored (with id 5f8ac...), categorized as UserProfile. The system also updated a belief (perhaps an internal identifier for "UserPreference-Color" was modified or reinforced). The client (assistant) can log this memoryId if needed or just proceed. Next time, the assistant might query for user preferences and retrieve this data. *Internal flow:* Upon this call, the backend (IIM) validated the input, then invoked CCE to categorize the content. Suppose CCE determined the text relates to user preferences, hence category "UserProfile" (and maybe tags like color). MES then stored it, generating the UUID and saving the content with metadata. BRCA saw this was about user’s favorite color, found or created a belief "User’s favorite color is blue" and saved that (if a prior belief existed with a different color, that would be marked as conflicting or updated). The response was then returned. All this happened within perhaps a few hundred milliseconds. In logs, one might see entries for each step (useful for debugging or audit).

### **Example 2: Retrieving Information for Context**

Scenario: Later, the user asks the assistant, “Do you remember my favorite color?” The AI assistant doesn’t directly “remember” beyond its short-term, so it queries the memory system for relevant info. Request: The assistant calls the retrieval API. It can do a GET with a query parameter or POST with a JSON. Using GET for simplicity:


GET /api/v1/memory/retrieve?agentId=assistant\_001\&query=favorite%20color&limit\=1
Authorization: Bearer \<TOKEN\>

Response: The API returns a JSON with matching memory. For instance:



{ "results": \[ { "memoryId": "5f8ac10b-708f-4d5b-9e18-6d34a9d3c888", "content": "The user stated their favorite color is blue.", "category": "UserProfile", "timestamp": "2025-06-06T20:22:00Z", "metadata": { "source": "chat\_message", "importance": "high" } } \], "query": "favorite color", "agentId": "assistant\_001", "count": 1 }
The assistant receives this and now knows the user’s favorite color was recorded as blue. It can confidently answer the user’s question: “Yes, you told me before that your favorite color is blue.” (This final answer might be composed by the assistant’s dialog system, possibly leveraging the composeResponse method of RRE if implemented). *Internal flow:* RRE received the query "favorite color" for agent\_001. It likely normalized the query (maybe removed stopwords) and searched the memory index. MES’s storage had indexed that memory under category "UserProfile" with content containing "favorite" and "blue". RRE finds it, maybe also consults the belief store (which confirms a belief about favorite color exists). It returns the memory record as the top result. If multiple favorite color entries were present (say multiple different statements over time), RRE might return the most recent or highest-confidence one first – this logic would be inside retrieveRelevant. The result count is 1 here since limit was 1, but without a limit the system could return all relevant mentions of "favorite color."

### **Example 3: Forgetting Old Data**

Scenario: The memory store for an agent has grown large. To optimize performance, the system (or an admin) decides to trigger a forgetting cycle to remove data older than 6 months that hasn’t been used recently. Request: An admin service calls the forgetting endpoint with an age-based strategy. For example, using POST:



curl \-X POST https://api.example.com/api/v1/memory/forget \\ \-H "Authorization: Bearer \<ADMIN\_TOKEN\>" \\ \-H "Content-Type: application/json" \\ \-d '{ "agentId": "assistant\_001", "strategy": "age", "threshold": "180d" }'
This asks the system to forget memories for agent\_001 older than 180 days (\~6 months). Response: The system responds with what it did:



{ "status": "success", "removedCount": 42, "removedItems": \[ { "memoryId": "AAA-b1", "reason": "expired" }, { "memoryId": "AAA-b2", "reason": "expired" }, "...": "..." \], "retainedCount": 310, "timestamp": "2025-06-06T20:40:00Z" }
This indicates 42 old memory entries were removed due to age, and now 310 remain for that agent. The removedItems list identifies some of them for audit (the list might be truncated for large numbers). The admin could log this or display a summary in a dashboard. *Internal flow:* The API layer calls REFA’s performForgetting with a strategy object (type=AGE, maxAge=180 days). REFA queries MES (or uses an index of lastAccessed timestamps) to find all memories older than the threshold and perhaps not accessed recently (depending on strategy specifics). It then calls MES.removeMemory(id) for each, which deletes them from storage. It compiles the report and returns it. If beliefs were associated with removed memories, BRCA might be notified to adjust confidences (e.g., if a belief lost all its supporting evidence due to forgetting, maybe mark that belief as low confidence or remove it as well). That detail would be handled internally by coordination between REFA, MES, and BRCA, but from the API perspective, the forgetting operation is done and results reported.

### **Example 4: Using Internal Interfaces (Developer Perspective)**

Scenario: A developer writing unit tests or integrating modules internally might use the Java interfaces directly (not through HTTP). For instance, after storing a memory, they might call BRCA to ensure beliefs update. Code Snippet:


MemoryInput input \= new MemoryInput("assistant\_001", "The sky is blue.", "statement", Instant.now(), new Metadata()); IngestionResult result \= ingestionModule.ingest(input); if (result.getStatus() \== Status.SUCCESS) { MemoryRecord rec \= memorySystem.getMemory(result.getMemoryId()); BeliefUpdateResult beliefRes \= beliefAnalyzer.analyzeNewMemory(rec); assert(beliefRes.getConflicts().isEmpty()); *// perhaps verify that a belief like "SkyColor=blue" is in reinforcedBeliefs* }
Here, ingestionModule is an instance implementing InformationIngestionModule, memorySystem is MemoryEncodingSystem, and beliefAnalyzer is BeliefReinforcementConflictAnalyzer. This demonstrates how the modules interact programmatically. In practice, the ingest() method of IIM likely already calls analyzeNewMemory inside it after storing, but this shows each piece can be used in isolation if needed. This is useful for testing each module independently (thanks to dependency inversion, we could mock ContextualCategorizationEngine to test IIM in isolation, etc.). These examples highlight typical interactions and verify that the API meets its use cases: adding knowledge, retrieving it when needed, and managing the memory lifecycle (including cleanup). Each step is authenticated and versioned properly as described next.

## **Authentication and Versioning**

Authentication: All external API calls must be authenticated to protect the agent’s memory data. The system will likely use token-based authentication (e.g., OAuth2 bearer tokens or API keys). In the examples above, we included an Authorization: Bearer \<TOKEN\> header. This token should be associated with either a specific agent or a client application authorized to access that agent’s memory. For multi-agent setups, the token and agentId together ensure isolation (an agent can only access its own memory unless a privileged token allows cross-agent access, for admin purposes). The API should validate the token on each request (statelessly, as per 12-factor's guideline for stateless services) and verify that the caller has rights for the requested operation (e.g., an admin scope for forgetting or deleting, a read vs write permission, etc.). Versioning: The API is versioned to allow evolution without breaking clients. In our specification, we used /api/v1/... as the base path. Version 1 (v1) indicates the first stable contract. If future changes are required (say a different request format or new default behaviors), a v2 can be introduced at a new endpoint prefix, while v1 continues to operate for older clients. Clients should include the version in the URL (or it can be negotiated via headers, but URL versioning is straightforward and cache-friendly). The interfaces defined above correspond to v1. To maintain backward compatibility, any changes within v1 should be additive (e.g., adding new optional fields) and not remove or drastically change existing fields (following Postel’s law for robust APIs). Internally, versioning might also apply: for example, the MemoryEncodingSystem could have different implementations for different storage versions. But those are hidden behind the interface. The external versioning is what clients rely on. All responses also include a timestamp and perhaps a version field or header (e.g., X-API-Version: 1.0) for clarity. The system’s configuration (12-factor principle \#3: Configuration) can determine the current version default and supported legacy versions via environment variables or config files, avoiding hard-coding such info. Security Considerations: In addition to authentication, the API should enforce authorization checks. For instance, an agent’s token should not allow calling forget unless it’s allowed to manage its own memory, and certainly not allowed to delete another agent’s memories. Admin tokens can be used for maintenance endpoints. All data transmitted should be over HTTPS to protect sensitive information (since memory content could be personal or confidential). The system should also log access for auditing – e.g., when forgetting is triggered or a memory is accessed via retrieval, to have a trail (but be mindful of not logging actual content to avoid leaks). 12-Factor and Cloud Deployment: The application should treat backing services (databases for memory storage, vector indexes, etc.) as attached resources, configured via environment variables

[dreamfactory.com](https://www.dreamfactory.com/resources/whitepapers/implementing-the-twelve-factor-app-methodology#:~:text=This%20principle%20emphasizes%20on%20the,are%20better%20suited%20as%20they)

. The statelessness means any node running the service can handle requests (the state is in the database/memory store). This allows horizontal scaling: multiple instances of the Memory API service behind a load balancer can serve ingestion and retrieval concurrently, each simply connecting to the same underlying data store or message queue. The design of endpoints (no client-specific state stored in memory between requests) adheres to this. For example, an ingestion request fully describes the data to add; a retrieval request includes all context needed (agentId, query) to get results. There is no session state across requests, which is aligned with 12-factor principle VI (processes are stateless and share-nothing)

[12factor.net](https://12factor.net/processes#:~:text=VI,as%20one%20or%20more%20processes)

. SOLID in Design: Each module interface we defined maps to a clear responsibility, and can be developed and tested in isolation (IIM for ingestion orchestration, CCE for classification logic, etc.). This modular approach is in line with the SOLID principles which aim to reduce tight coupling and increase maintainability

[bmc.com](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/solid-design-principles/#:~:text=Why%20use%20SOLID%20principles%20in,programming)

. For instance, if a new AI categorization model is developed, one can implement ContextualCategorizationEngine in a new class and plug it in without changing IIM or others. If scaling becomes an issue, one could deploy CCE as a separate microservice (with the interface possibly turning into a remote API) and IIM would still call it the same way (maybe via HTTP client instead of in-process, but hidden behind the interface). This flexibility is by design. Error Handling and Version Compatibility: The API should return clear error messages and codes. Common errors include: 400 Bad Request for invalid input (with details which field is wrong), 401 Unauthorized if token missing/invalid, 403 Forbidden if token lacks permission for that action, 404 Not Found if referring to a memoryId or endpoint that doesn’t exist, and 500 Internal Server Error for unexpected issues. The response format for errors should be consistent, e.g.:



{ "status": "error", "errorMessage": "Description of the error", "code": 400 }
This is implied in our design through the status and errorMessage fields in various response DTOs. Versioning also means that if a client calls an older version endpoint, the new fields might not appear (or might be null), but core functionality remains. Conversely, new clients using v2 will not accidentally call v1 due to the URL change. This ensures continuous delivery of improvements without breaking older integrations, a hallmark of robust API design.

## **Conclusion**

In summary, the Memory API system for CIBFE provides a comprehensive, modular approach to managing an AI agent’s long-term memory and beliefs. We defined clear external endpoints for all major operations: ingestion of new information, optional explicit categorization and encoding, belief updates to maintain knowledge consistency, forgetting to manage relevance over time, and retrieval to supply context to the agent when needed. Each internal module is specified with Java interfaces, reinforcing separation of concerns and allowing the system to be built and evolved according to SOLID principles. The design follows 12-factor app methodology, ensuring the application is suitable for cloud deployment with stateless services, configuration-driven setup, and horizontal scalability
